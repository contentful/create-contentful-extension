This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run configure`

This will help you configure your development environment, it will log into
contentful if necessary, and then help you choose the space and environment you
wish to use with your app.


### `npm start`

Creates or update your app definition in contentful, and runs the app in the 
development mode.
Open your app  to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
